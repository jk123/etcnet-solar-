# WHMCS Twenty-One Theme - Dark Mode (Custom CSS)

This is a WHMCS client area, dark mode child theme for Twenty-one. CSS file generated with Gemini 3 Pro.

This solution overrides the default theme colors using the `custom.css` file, meaning it does not require modifying core template files and is persistent through WHMCS updates (as long as the `custom.css` file is preserved).

## Features

This stylesheet corrects and darkens the following areas that often remain white by default:

* **General Look:** Dark background (#121212) and light text.
* **Navigation:** Top Bar, Main Navbar, and Footer.
* **Dashboard:** Homepage tiles (Services, Domains, Tickets), "Active Products" cards, and sidebars.
* **Tables:** Dark backgrounds for tables, corrected header rows, and text colors.
* **Pagination:** Fixed "Previous" and "Next" buttons (no longer white blocks).
* **Forms:** Input fields, dropdowns, and search bars.
* **Specific Fixes:**
    * Removes white backgrounds from "Why Choose Us" marketing blocks.
    * Fixes the Domain Search background area on the homepage.
    * Darkens the "Breadcrumb" bar (Secondary Header).
